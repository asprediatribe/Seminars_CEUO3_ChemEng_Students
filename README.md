# Seminars_CEUO3_ChemEng_Students
This repository comprises templates and scripts essential for hands-on sessions during the computational seminars of the Unit Operation 3 course. Students can utilize these files to address the self-study problems corresponding to each week's material, as outlined in the Self-Study Material available on LEARN. The self-study problems should be developed weekly to enhance the learning experience. The templates provided here serve as guides to enhance the learning experience and streamline the time spent in seminars, particularly during hands-on sessions. Typically, participants copy, analyze, and complete these templates in the corresponding Python interface.
